## Environment setup
1. Create the environment from the environment.yml file:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name. 

2. Activate the new environment: 
```
conda activate myenv
```
3. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
```
conda env list
```
